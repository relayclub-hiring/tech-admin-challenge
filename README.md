# Technical Team Administrator

Congratulations! Presumably, you've applied for our [Technical Team Administrator](https://hiring-relay-club.pages.dev/jobs/tech-administrator) position. Based on preliminary interviews we want to continue our hiring process with you. The final step will be an interview with Jim Fields, our CEO. But before that, we want to see how you really work, and we want you to see what working at Relay.club is like. This is our “work sample” project.

### Timeframe and deadline
Do this on your own time at your own pace. There is no time limit but we respect your time and don't want you to spend more than 2 hours on the task. We expect you'll be able to find time in the next week. If you don't have time to work on it, please let us know.

### How you'll be evaluated
Here's how we will evaluate your work:
- English language writing skills. You can use a free tool such as Google Docs, Grammarly, or Quillbot to check your typos, grammar, and syntax.
- Your research skills. Can you quickly use Google to get comprehensive, thorough, and relevant answers to our questions.
- Your analytical skills. Can you appreciate our primary concerns and make a recommendation based on the criteria we provide.

### The project
We want you to recommend a *product management* tool for us. You probably know about general project management tools that help track progress on tasks. Such tools include:
- Trello
- Asana
- Clickup

You might also have used specialized issue tracking tools for software engineering teams, such as:
- Jira
- Pivotal Tracker
- Shortcut

You may not know about a relatively new group of SaaS tools called product management tools. Expert product managers have developed these tools so beginners will be successful with product management. We think one of these tools might be helpful in product planning at Relay.club. But which one?

### What we want from you
- Give us a list of product management tools you've found using Google.
- Include comparative pricing for each tool, including notes about any free trial, organized so we can compare "at a glance" and ranked from cheap to expensive.
- List interesting features that we might want to use.
- Make a recommendation of the top 1 to 3 tools that you think we should consider, based on our needs.

### Our needs
We don't expect you to do a complete evaluation of each tool in the 2 hours you work on this project. But keep our requirements in mind as you consider whether each tool is worth a deeper look.
- The tool will be used by our COO, our CTO, and our engineers
- We need one place to see all our product development projects.
- We want to see the status of any project at a glance.
- We want to assign a priority to each project, further identifying each as "current," "planned," or "backlog."
- We want to assign team members to a project and display all projects each team member is working on.
- We want to see a timeline or roadmap of projects we've scheduled.
- We want a structured template that will help us write "product requirement documents" for each project.
- We want to add comments to project documents so we can discuss requirements and report on progress.
- Nice to have: Integration with Jira, Slack, Figma, GitHub, or Notion.

### Why we ask you to do this
Your work as a Technical Team Administrator will require some low-visibility work like keeping a list of all the vendors and services we use. Other tasks will be more high-profile, like gathering status reports and presenting progress updates to our founders. But your greatest long-term and strategic impact will involve research and assessments for technology and services, just like this work sample. We want to see how you do. Good luck and have fun!

### How to submit your work
We've invited you to this private GitHub repo where you can submit your work. If you've never used GitHub, we expect you to figure out how to edit this `README.md` file. Hint: There is a pencil icon somewhere near the top of this page. When you are done editing and ready to submit, click the button "Commit changes."

You can use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to format your report.

After you submitt your work sample, send an email to let us know that you're done. We do reviews in batches 1-2 times a week. You'll hear back from us in a few days. If you don't hear from us after we said you would, poke us for an update. That shouldn't happen, but if it does it means we screwed something up and missed you. We will never ghost you.
