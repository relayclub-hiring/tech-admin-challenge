# Technical Team Administrator

Congratulations! Presumably, you've applied for our¬†[Technical Team Administrator](https://hiring-relay-club.pages.dev/jobs/tech-administrator) position. We want to see how you will execute a typical work assignment. This is our ‚Äúwork sample‚Äù project.

### Timeframe and deadline
Please complete this task at your own pace and on your own time. There is no specific time limit, but we value your time and do not want you to spend more than 2 hours on it. We hope you will be able to find time to work on it within the next week. If you are unable to find time, please let us know.

### How you'll be evaluated
Here's how we will evaluate your work:
- English language writing skills: We will assess the clarity and accuracy of your writing, including proper spelling, grammar, and syntax. We recommend using tools like Google Docs, Grammarly, or Quillbot to check for errors.
- Research skills: We will look at how you use ChatGPT and Google to answer our questions.
- Analytical skills: We want to see if you can identify the main points of concern and provide a recommendation based on the criteria we have provided.

### What you will need
- Free ChatGPT account at https://chat.openai.com/chat
- Google

### Why we ask you to do this
As a Technical Team Administrator, you will be responsible for some low-visibility tasks, such as maintaining a list of all the vendors and services we use. Other tasks will be more visible, such as gathering status reports and reporting progress to our founders. But your greatest long-term and strategic impact will involve research and assessments for technology and services, just like this work sample. We want to see how you do. Good luck and have fun!

### The project
We want you to recommend a *product management* tool for us. You probably know about general project management tools that help track progress on tasks. Such tools include:
- Trello
- Asana
- Clickup
You might also have used specialized issue tracking tools for software engineering teams, such as:
- Jira
- Pivotal Tracker
- Shortcut
We don't want you to recommend any of these tools. Instead, we want you to research a relatively new group of SaaS tools called product management tools. Expert product managers have developed these tools so beginners will be successful with product management. We think one of these tools might be helpful in product planning at Relay.club. But which one?

### What we want from you
- Use ChatGPT to learn about the difference between product management tools and project management tools. Show us the questions you ask ChatGPT and summarize what you find out in one paragraph.
- Use ChatGPT to get a list of the features of product management tools. Show us the questions you ask ChatGPT and summarize what you learn in one paragraph.
- Use Google to get a list of product management tools. Show us the search terms you use and give us a list of product management tools you've found using Google. Try to be comprehensive.
- Provide comparative pricing for each tool, including notes about any free trial, organized so we can compare "at a glance," ranked from cheap to expensive.
- List features of each tool that match our needs, and any additional interesting features you think we should consider.
- Make a recommendation of the top 1 to 3 tools that you think we should consider, based on our needs.

### Our needs
We don't expect you to do a complete evaluation of each tool in the 2 hours you work on this project. But keep our requirements in mind as you consider whether each tool is worth a deeper look.
- The tool will be used by our COO and our CTO, not just our engineers.
- We need see all projects at a glance, with current status, plus a priority such as "current," "planned," or "backlog," plus the names of the team members assigned to a project.
- We want to see a timeline or roadmap of projects.
- The product should provide a structured template to help us write "product requirement documents" for each project.
- We want to add comments to project documents so we can discuss requirements and report on progress.

### How to submit your work
We've invited you to this private GitHub repo where you can submit your work. If you've never used GitHub, we expect you to figure out how to edit this `README.md` file. Hint: There is a pencil icon somewhere near the top of this page, next to the word "Blame." Add your work sample at the end of the file. When you are done editing and ready to submit, click the button "Commit changes."

Don't spend time formatting a document and creating a PDF with fancy tables or charts. Just use plain text, in the Markdown format, to add your answers at the end of this document. 

After you submitt your work sample, send an email to let us know that you're done. We do reviews in batches 1-2 times a week. You'll hear back from us in a few days. If you don't hear from us after we said you would, poke us for an update. That shouldn't happen, but if it does it means we screwed something up and overlooked you. We will never ghost you.
